\section{Weighted Deming regression}
In both forms of Deming regression, $\lambda$ is assumed to be
constant through out the range of measurements.

For WDR weights $w_{i}$ are used to compute the sums of squares
and cross products. The weights are inversely proportional to the
squared analytical variance at any given value.
