## Preinstallation of `R` Packages.

The host venue will provide WIFI access, but please be mindful that the quality may suffer when everyone is attempting to download something simultaneously. To mitigate this risk, we encourage all attendees to download recommended R packages in advance of the workshop.

* Downloading a R package for RStudio.

 - Go to the "Tools" menu.
 - Select the first option "Install Packages"
 - A dialogue box will appear. The second item in this dialog box will read "Packages (Separate multiple with space or comma)".
 - In the space just underneath, type in the R package that you wish to install.
 
 * Some of R packages that we will use for the workshop are
  <pre><code>
  tidyverse, sf, ggmaps, tmap, plotly, knitr
