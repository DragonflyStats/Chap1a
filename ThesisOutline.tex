\section{Outline of Thesis}
	Thus the study of method comparison is introduced. The intention of this thesis is to progress the
	study of method comparison studies, using a statistical method known as Linear mixed effects models.
	Chapter two shall describe linear mixed effects models, and how the use of the linear mixed
	effects models have so far extended to method comparison studies. Implementations of important existing work shall be presented, using the \texttt{R} programming language.
	
	Model diagnostics are an integral component of a complete statistical analysis.
	In chapter three model diagnostics shall be described in depth, with particular
	emphasis on linear mixed effects models, further to chapter two.
	
	For the fourth chapter, important linear mixed effects model diagnostic methods shall be extended to method comparison studies, and proposed methods shall be demonstrated on data sets that have become well known in literature on method comparison. The purpose is to both calibrate these methods and to demonstrate applications for them.
	The last chapter shall focus on robust measures of important parameters such as agreement.
