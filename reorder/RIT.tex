A Study of the Bland-Altman Plot and its Associated Methodology
by
Joseph G. Voelkel and Bruce E. Siskowski
Abstract
Consider the situation in which two measurement devices are compared but no “true”
value exists. For this problem, when a set of subjects are measured with both de-
vices, Bland and Altman have strongly criticized several methods of analysis. They
advocated a plot of the differences in each subject’s readings versus the average of
such readings and statistics associated with it. They recommended this plot both for
checking assumptions, such as homogeneity of variances, and for assessing the agree-
ment between the devices. They also advocated several other methods associated
with such comparisons. We argue that a sound comparison of devices should do more
than measure agreement—for example, every comparison of devices should also com-
pare the repeatability of the devices, a measure that cannot be obtained by simply
measuring agreement. We show how the Bland-Altman plot and associated meth-
ods can itself be misleading through several examples. We propose another method,
structural equation modeling, as the mathematical framework for such studies. We
critique another method suggested by Bland and Altman for measuring agreement
when the devices are measuring the phenomenon on different scales that are thought
to be linearly related, and suggest alternative methods. We continue to advocate
the use of the Bland-Altman plot, when used cautiously, as one of several ways for
checking model adequacy.
1 Introduction
An important consideration in many areas of medicine is the comparison of mea-
surement devices, especially when no “true” value can be measured. As Bland and
Altman (1986) noted, “Clinicians often wish to have data on, for example, cardiac
stroke volume or blood pressure where direct measurement without adverse effects is
difficult or impossible. The true values remain unknown. Instead indirect methods
are used, and a new method has to be evaluated by comparison with an established
technique rather than with the true quantity. If the new method agrees sujﬁciently
well with the old, the old may be replaced, This is very different from calibration,
where known quantities are measured by a new method and the result compared
1



with the true value or with measurements made by a highly accurate method. When
two methods are compared neither provides an unequivocally correct measurement,
so we try to assess the degree of agreement. But how?" (Italics ours.) The idea of
agreement plays a key role in Bland and Altman analyses of device comparisons, a
point to which we will return later.
Earlier, Altman and Bland (1983) had addressed this question because of the sta-
tistically incorrect methods of analysis they had witnessed in the medical literature,
including correlation analysis, regression analysis, and hypothesis tests to compare
means. To correct these deﬁciencies, they proposed a simple graphical technique that
has become widely used in the medical literature. A set of subjects is selected, prefer-
ably at random from the population of interest, but at least to cover the range of
values over which the devices should be compared. Each subject’s feature is measured
on each of the two devices in such a way that it is reasonable to compare the measure-
ments. A graph is then made of (a) the differences Y — X between the two readings
vs (b) the average (X + Y) /2 of the two readings. Note that this basic plot is based
on exactly one measurement from each device for each subject we refer to this as
the one-measurement case. This plot, commonly called the Bland-Altniaii plot, has
gained wide acceptance in the medical literature. Similarly, their recommendations
for investigating the data using this plot, as well as related recommendations, may
be called the Bland-Altman method.
The plot and the method underlying it does essentially examine the agreement
between the two techniques—large differences (where “large” should be clinically
determined) indicate the two device do not agree well. Altman and Bland (1983)
continued their argument by stating “[t]he main emphasis in method comparison
studies clearly rests on a direct comparison of the results obtained by the alternative
methods. The question to be answered is whether the methods are comparable to
the extent that one might replace the other with suﬁicient accuracy for the intended
purpose of measurement.“ (Italics ours.)
By using this plot instead of a plot of Y vs. X, Altman and Bland (1983) noted
that it is “much easier to assess the magnitude of the disagreement (both error and
bias)” as well as other features in the data such as outliers and to “see if there is
any trend, for example an increase in Y — X for high values.” (Bland and Altman
used A and B instead of Y and X, but we substitute our terminology in their quotes
for consistency in this paper.) If such an increase (or decrease) takes place, they
suggested attempting a transformation of the raw data. They continue, “[i]n the
absence of a suitable transformation it may be reasonable to describe the differences
between the method by regressing Y — X on (X + Y) /2.” The same point is stated
in Bland and Altman (1995): “There may also be a trend in the bias, a tendency
for the mean difference to rise or fall with increasing magnitude. . . In [the] ﬁgure . . .
for example, therc is an increase in bias with magnitude, shown by the positive slope
of the regression line.” They again suggest that a transformation may eliminate this
effect. The model they appear to have considered in their article will be shown in
2



Section 3.
The 1983 article, which included a number of excellent insights on measurement
studies from the view of applied statistics, had a strong impact on the ways in which
such studies were analyzed. The purposes of our article are to review this plot and
the associated methodology proposed by Bland and Altman, to note some difficulties
with this methodology, and to recommend alternative analyses.
2 On Comparing Measurement Devices
In our experience, a measurement-device study is usually conducted to address the
following questions:
1. Are the devices identical in their ability? This is equivalent to the word “inter-
changeability” used in ﬁelds of testing and instrumentation.
2. If they are not identical as is,  can they be made so after calibration? Or (b)
are they measuring the same features but with different precision?
3. If they are not identical even after calibration or allowing for different precision,
are they measuring the same features on the subjects, after calibration and
allowing for different precision?
4. If they are not measuring the same features, to what extent are they measuring
diﬁerent features on the subjects?
From the italicized section of the Bland—Altman quotes that we have cited, and
from the extensive writings of Bland and Altman, their key emphasis is to try to assess
the extent to which the devices agree. “The question to be answered is whether the
methods are comparable to the extent that one might replace the other with sufficient
accuracy for the intended purpose of measurement.”
Whether two measurements are close enough must be determined from clinical
considerations, so suppose that “close” has been deﬁned. If a study is conducted that
can address the four questions we pose, then it can address the questions posed by
Bland and Altman. However, if the study only addresses the question posed by Bland
and Altman, it can not necessarily address the questions we have posed.
Consider the one-measurement case. The assumption that the current device
provides consistent readings cannot be ascertained from the one-measurement case,
so it is possible that the current device does not agree very well with (is not “close to”)
itself. If the current measurement device is not particularly precise, it is possible—
using the BA method—that the new device is more precise than the old one, but
cannot be used to replace it.

3 Mathematical Model
The model we use in this paper is the common and useful structural model (e.g.
Fuller(l987)). This is a natural model for the comparison of two devices. See, e.g.,
Mandel (1984), who used this technique on data from the U.S. National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST). This model is a simple example of structural
equations with latent variables, e.g. Bollen (1989).
Consider the case of two measuring devices. Let 90,  represents the long—term
average (“true”) value of the measurement for the it,‘ subject when measured on
the ac-device (y-device) at a some ﬁxed point in time. (The “ﬁxed point in time" is
needed in the medical ﬁeld, because the underlying values often change over time for
subjects.) The structural model assumes that these  yi) values lie on a straight
line this means that the two devices are measuring the same feature on a given
subject except that a possible linear calibration needs to be made. However, we
cannot observe the values directly. Instead, we only observe readings X ,4 and Yji,
j : 1, . . . , J, for each subject. The associated model that is used is the following,
where i _ 1, ...,N.
3/1' = 50 ‘t /31151 (1)
$0,; ~ ind N (um, 02,)
._  + 6]-,-, 6], ~ ind N (0, rig)
Yb I yi time in ~iI1d N (0» ‘Til
all {($14}, {.214} are independent
When J > 1, we are considering the ease in which the same observer is making
repeat measurements over a short period of time. We will not consider more complex,
yet important cases here, such as when the study is designed to include measurements
by multiple observers  topic avoided by Bland and Altman as well, e.g. (2003).)
Assuming we have a data set rich enough to estimate all parameters, this model
allows us to address questions l—3 that we had posed. For example, we would say the
two devices are identical if [30 : 0,[i1 : 1, and rig : 0%.
The case in which the (mi, 7,/,3) values do not lie on a straight line is also important.
In particular the larger model in which we replace the ﬁrst line in (1) with
711‘ : 50 +/319% +§i=§i N ind N (07 U?) (2)
should usually be considered as well, as this addresses question 4 above. We will use
this model only in Section 8. We will refer to this model as the extended structural
model in this paper. This model is a general alternative to the ﬁrst line in (1), so it
will have some power in detecting smooth non-linear alternatives, random differences
from the linear ﬁt, and occasional outliers.

When we follow the examples typically presented by Bland and Altman, we need
to consider the one-mearsurement case in which J I 1, and here we write X, and Y;
instead of X], and 
Let “Jill/N (pf, 2')” represent a multivariate normal distribution with mean vec-
tor /d' and variance-covariance matrix Z)’. From the model, it is straightforward to
show that (X, Y) has a bivariate normal distribution:

where we write R5,», I 0'5/0'1 and R5,; I 05/0,; to denote key ratios of standard
deviations. Note that R51 I 0 corresponds to no measurement error for the 1' device,
and R5,; I 1 corresponds to equally precise devices. (We will not consider the R5, I O
case, but doing so would require that RMRE5 (the only way in which R55 appears) be
rewritten as 05/0,)
It follows that the data used in the BA plot is a sample from a bivariate normal
distribution:

Using a sample of data, (X,-,Y¢), i I 1,2, ...,N, we can calculate the sample
mean and variance-covariance matrix of the original data, or equivalently of the data
corresponding to the BA plot (Y, — Xi, (Y1; + X,-) /2), i I 1,2, ...,N. Either set of
the sample means and variance-covariance matrix provide minimal suﬂicient statistics
for the mathematical model. Mathematically, this minimal suﬂiciency holds for the
normal distribution—from a more general point of view, we could consider any case
where we believe the sample mean and variance-covariance matrix provide a good
summary of the data.
There is an immediate problem here. It is well known that the parameter es-
timation in the model based on (1) is indeterminate (not identiﬁable) in the one-
5



measurement case. The reason is clear—there are six parameters that need to be
estimated in the model, but the sufﬁcient statistics only provide ﬁve quantities. It is
therefore also true that the sufficient statistics associated with (4)-(5), and therefore
the Bland-Altman plot of the associated raw data, can not provide enough information
to estimate the parameters. We refer to this as the p7‘0bl677L of imleterminacy. Altman
and Bland (e.g., 1983) discuss the usefulness of estimating repeatability (which can
be done in the multiple-measurement case for which J > 1). However, their word-
ing suggests that they view repeatability as somehow distinct from a comparison of
methods. It is true that repeatability estimates for a device require only that device.
However, a comparison of methods needs to include information on repeatability, not
be isolated from it.
The normality assumption on the 6 and 5 error terms is common, theoretically
defensible, and is reasonable for many data sets. The normality assumption on the .r
term is also reasonable, although situations may arise in which it is questionable. For
example, the researcher may wish to screen subjects to try to make an .r distribution
that is more uniform over the range of values. In such a case, a theoretical difficulty
immediately arises. If all the assumptions of (1) hold except that ac is non-normal
(but is still sampled from a continuous distribution), then the regression of Y on X
is no longer linear (Lindley, 1947). This means that non-linear features observed in
such a graph may reflect only how the 9; values were sampled, an awkward situation
for a data analyst. We have not investigated to what extent this non-linearity is of
practical importance for the problem at hand.
The normality assumption also plays a role in the non-identiﬁability problem. For
example, Reiersr/ll (1950) showed that [31 is identiﬁable if 1 is non-normal. However,
this appears to be mostly of theoretical interest. See Spiegelman (1979) and the
references contained therein for details on estimation of this parameter.
4 Bland and Altman Papers: A Review
We shall examine several publications to which one or both of these authors con-
tributed, with an emphasis based on the modeling that underlies their work.
In the Altman and Bland (1983) paper, the model they refer to in their Appendix
is restricted to 61 : 1 and [30 : 0. They essentially employ means, variances, and
covariances (or correlations, or looking for trend in the BA plot) in their paper,
although they do refer to the normal distribution on occasion. In their analysis,
however, they clearly don’t restrict themselves to 50 : 0, and it appears that the
ﬂl = 1 restriction is assumed to be tested by the data through the BA plot. For
example, when comparing the BA plot to the Y vs. X plot, they use the phrase “...it
is much easier to...see whether there is any trend, for example an increase in Y — X
for high values [of (X + Y) /2].” However, they do not appear to say What such a
trend means, except to note that a test of /1y_Xv(X+y)/2 I O is equivalent to a test of
a§( : 0%,. This statement, although true, does not directly aid the user in comparing
6



the two measurement devices because the test “O'§( = 0?,” is equivalent to the test
“oi + 0? : 5%; + erg” see  Unless the analyst is simply Willing to assume that
ﬂl = 1 or that rig = 0?, the results of this test do not lend themselves to simple
interpretation. For example, Maloney and Rastogi (1970), based on earlier Work of
Pitman (1939) and Morgan (1939), test HO : cg 7 cg, but assume [31 : 1 in doing so.
The sample standard deviation of Y —X is said to be “the estimate of error“ (ital-
ics theirs), although “error” is not deﬁned there, for example in terms of parameters.
. . 2 2
Based on the structural model their error term estimates ,/J2 (Q — 1) + 0' + 02

which also does not lend itself to simple interpretation unless the user wants to as-
sume artiﬁcially that that ﬂl = 1. It is reasonable to state that, if this error term
is suitably small (clinically), the methods could likely be used interchangeably in a
clinical setting even here, though, estimates of all the parameters in the structural
equation model would provide additional scientiﬁc insight. Of course, one doesn’t
have this information When the study is being designed.
It is also not clear to us Altman and Bland proposed that “[ilf there is an asso-
ciation between the differences and the size of the measurements, then as before, a
transformation (of the raw data) may be successfully employed.” Unless larger mea-
surements are associated with larger repeatability values or unless the association is
nonlinear, a nonlinear transformation appears unwarranted.
The authors noted, after a review of some incorrect methods of analysis that We
mentioned earlier in this article, “[n]one of the previously discussed approaches tells
us Whether the methods can be considered equivalent.” Unfortunately, neither does
theirs. It is precisely the use of structural equation models (including the extended
model as a starting point) along with checks of assumptions, that can answer the
equivalence question directly.
We do not agree with Altman and Bland (1983), who rejected structural equation
models as being too complex. Good researchers should use the best techniques avail-
able that can directly answer the questions We have posed for measurement studies—
the fact that many researchers do not should not dissuade us. As those authors
correctly note, “[i]t is difﬁcult to produce a method that will be appropriate for all
circumstances...clearly the various possible complexities that could arise might require
a modiﬁed approach, involving additional or even alternate analyses.” The authors’
claim that “[t]he majority of medical method comparison studies seem to be carried
out Without the beneﬁt of professional statistical expertise” suggests to us that such
expertise should be obtained.
Bland and Altman (2003) cited more recent references in medical statistics jour-
nals to again point out the errors of the use of correlation and regression analysis.
All the examples, unfortunately, seem to be the one-measurement case, for which
no method of analysis can address the questions that should be answered in such a
study. The authors provide a nice example, using fetal lung measurements, of the
use of the BA plot in checking assumptions. In this example, a non-constant variance
7



was evident. However, their statement, “when X and Y have the same SD, as they
should if they are measurements of the same thing, Y —X and (Y + X) / 2 should not
be correlated at all in the absence of a true relationship," is not quite accurate, as
(5) indicates. (They stated this more carefully in Bland and Altman (1995).) They
noted the design they mentioned in their 1986 paper in which replicate measurements
were taken on each subject and “regret that this has not been more Widely adopted
by researchers.”
In that paper, they also suggested an “appropriate use of regression” for the case
in which a new method has different units than the old method (but, presumably,
is linearly related in some sense). We examine that recommendation later in this
article.
5 Example 1: PEFR
The mathematical indeterminacy in the one-measurement case is well known. Bland
and Altman often avoid an explicit model in their Work so it is not clear if they
are aware of this problem. In fact, they state (1983) that the “considerable extra
complexity of such analysis will not be justified if a simple comparison is all that is
required” and that this is especially true when the “results must be conveyed to and
used by non-experts, e.g. clinicians.” We disagree with this comment, and show in
our Example 4 that summaries of results need not be complex. We are also preparing
a paper for publication that we hope will make such modeling easier for practitioners
to understand, perform, and summarize.
Using the structural equation model, What effect does this problem of indetermi-
nacy have on making practical decisions when comparing two devices? lt can have
a very important effect, as we illustrate with an example. Keep in mind that we
are only considering the one-measurement case—if multiple measurements are made
on each subject this indeterminacy disappears, although the BA plot alone (now of
averages for each subject) still does not capture all the information needed.
Our example focuses on parameter estimation, not parameter uncertainty. The
results we show hold true whether the data sets are based on N : 10 or N : 10, 000—
parameter uncertainty is not the issue in parameter indeterminacy.
Here is our approach. To get estimates of the parameters, we will perform a
sensitivity analysis. We do this by pretending that one of the six quantities is known,
and then varying this quantity over a range of values. Each ﬁxed value of this quantity
allows us to ﬁnd estimates of the remaining quantities.
An examination of (4)-(5) reveals that the values of B0 and ax only appear in 
The oz parameter is not useful when comparing two methods. The /50 parameter,
while important (measuring one aspect of bias), is fairly straightforward to correct.
For these reasons, we will simplify our analysis by ignoring this information. This
leaves us with four unknown parameters for which we have three estimates, as shown
in (5) or  We will use the latter form of the variance-covariance matrix, so
8



(am, 51, R5,, R55) are the unknown parameters.
One of the strong disagreements We have with the BA method is that the BA
method cannot indicate which device is more precise. But we believe that this precision
question, and not a measure of agreement, is often a crucial measure by which a device
should be judged. For this reason we select a variety of R55 values for our sensitivity
analysis. The R55 parameter also has a range of possible values that is independent
of the data, making it a natural choice for sensitivity work.
The relationship of (0,, 51, RM) to (E, R55) is presented in Appendix A. For a set
of data, We can obtain the sample variance-covariance matrix S from the differeiices
and averages. We replace E with S in (6) and equate the terms to ﬁnd estimates of
(0,, B1, R5,) as a function of R5,; for this S.
The example We use is from Altman (1995), p. 270, and details are provided in
Bland and Altman (1986). We selected this example because Bland and Altman have
used it repeatedly to explain their methods. The data set is based on N I 17 subjects.
PEFR (peak expiratory ﬂow rate) measurements Were obtained for each subject, both
on a Wright meter (X) and a Mini meter  (In fact, several measurements were
made 011 each device for each subject, but Altman used only the ﬁrst measurement
from each device as an example of the BA plot.) We will usually suppress the units,
liters/min, for brevity. The sample variance-covariance matrix of this set of data is
(variance of Y — X) S11 I 15027353, (variance of (Y + X) /2) S22 I 127861324,
and (covariance) S12 I 366.8015.
Based on this matrix, We generated the results in Figure 1. We have chosen to
display this graph over a Wide range of R55 I U5/0'5 values to emphasize that the
data themselves provide no evidence of this value. Without additional information,
such as that provided by making repeat measurements on each subject, any of the
values shown on this graph are equally likely (equal likelihoods) to have given rise to
the data observed.
For example, consider three R85 scenarios:
1. Mini meter much less precise than the Wright meter, by a factor of 10. With
08/<75 I 10, We ﬁnd [31 I 0.97, 6,; I 3.84, rig I 38.4.
2. Mini meter as precise as the Wright meter. With 0'5/0'5 I 1, we ﬁnd 31 I 1.03,
6,; I 65 I 27.3.
3. Mini meter much more precise than the Wright meter, by a factor of 10. With
as/0,; I 0.1, we ﬁnd 51 I 1.09, 6,; I 37.4, 65 I 3.74.
Bland (1995, p. 272) noted “the standard deviation of the differences is estimated
to be 38.8 litres/min ...” He further adds that (italics ours) “[0/n the basis of these
data we would not conclude that the two devices are comparable or that the mini-meter
could reliably replace the Wright peak flow meter.” (He added that the Mini meter
had received considerable wear, but this is outside the scope of the data themselves.)

We would instead conclude on the basis of these data that there is absolutely
no evidence for whether the two devices are comparable or whether the Mini meter
or the Wright meter is a more precise measuring device such estimates can not be
obtained from these data.
In the R5,; limits, the parameter ﬁl (or its estimate, for a sample of data) is the
regression parameter of Y on X (if R5,; t? oo) or the the inverse of the regression
parameter of X on Y (if R85 —> O). In the case where R5,; = l (U? = 0?), B1 is
the orthogonal (principal component) regression parameter. For example, the slope
estimate found by regressing the Wright data on the Mini data is 0.97, which is the
limit of Z31 as R55 —> oo, and the slope estimate found by regressing the Mini data on
the Wright data is 0.92, and 1/0.92 : 1,09, the limit of B, as R5,; a 0.
Bland’s estimated variance of the differences is (38.8)2, which is simply S11. Prom
(5), this estimate is biased upwards unless ﬂl = 1. However, for this data set, the
bias is slight see Figure 2. The maximum occurs at 38.8 for the value of Rd; that
corresponds to B1 = 1. The relatively stability shown in this example corresponds to
comments made in Bland and Altman (1995).
Finally, we examine how 5*, varies as a function of R5,;—see Figure 3. This feature

of the data exhibits relatively slight variation. Because this is a parameter associated
with the population being measured rather than the measurement devices themselves,
we will not examine this parameter any further.
To emphasize that any of the values associated with these ﬁgures are equally likely
to have given rise the observed data, We generated 100 pairs of simulated data from
each of the three R55 scenarios listed above‘ We also estimated the corresponding pm
and 50 to center the results appropriately. We then graphed the PEFR data and also
overlaid the PEFR data for each scenario. We selected N I 100 for each scenario to
smooth out some of the random variation.
See Figure 4. The three scenarios have very different values of the underlying
parameters, but result in bivariate data that are being sampled from the same distri-
bution. The BA plots, which we do not graph here, are simply a rotation and possible
re-scaling of these results.

representation of the data, What estimates (and uncertainties) are associated with the
parameters of the model? Such estimates, by providing a summary of the data if the
model is reasonable, can then be used to make summaries and help aid in decisions.
Second, does the tentative model in fact provide a reasonable representation of the
data? If so, good; if not, decisions need to be made whether to use the model anyway,
to use another model, or to abandon the idea of modeling. A simple example is in
linear regression, in which a tentative model is used and the data are ﬁt to the model
assuming the model is reasonable; and then a residual analysis is performed to see if
the model is reasonable.
This article has emphasized the ﬁrst aspect of this analysis, for which the BA plot
does not provide enough information. However, the BA plot is valuable in addressing
whether the model is reasonable, For example, the plot can be useful in detecting
outliers, in detecting higher variability at higher readings, and in detecting non-
linear relationships. Bland and Altman use such checks as part of their method.
Note however, that checks of a constant difference (ﬁl I 1) can be misleading, as We
illustrate in Example 2.
We have emphasized the one-measurement case, because this appears to be how
the BA method is most frequently used. We strongly recommend that no measurement-
comparison study ever be conducted unless it includes multiple measurements per
subject on each machine (unless this is physically impossible). If so, then all six pa-
rameters may be estimated under the structural model. In fact, because the minimal
suﬂicient statistics are of dimension seven, this structural model can be tested against
the extended structural model. See Example 4.
In such a case, the BA plot should be based on the average readings for each
subject on each machine. Without explicitly incorporating information on the esti-
mates of 0'5 and <75, the plot still suffers the same indeterminacy and its use should
be restricted to graphical examination of the assumptions behind the model.
7 Example 2. Blood Pressure
Bland and Altman are aware that problems can exist in interpreting graphs in which
measurement variation exists. For example, in their 1995 paper, they criticized the
method that has sometimes been advocated of plotting the difference against one of
the measurements, say X, often the “gold standard”—see their paper for references.
They correctly point out how this can be misleading, and instead recommended the
Bland-Altman approach.
Plotting the difference against the X measurements is misleading, because

They state “[t]his is zero if the variances are equal, and will be small unless there
is a marked di1'lerence in the variability between subjects for the two methods" They
precede this by stating “[i]f the study includes a Wide range of measurements, and
unless the two methods of measurement have very poor agreement, we expect 03¢ and
0%, to be similar and p to be fairly large, at least 0.7."
The set of data they examined was a random sub-sample of 200 blood pressure
readings from a larger study—the sample of size 200 was used to avoid clutter in their
graphs. For those data, the estimate of /Jy_X,(X+y)/2 is U17, with a 95% confidence
interval that excludes 0. They note, in line with (9) that this correlation may be
non-zero if either there is a trend in the relationship (our ﬁl > 1, for example) or if
“one method has considerably more measurement error than the other...” and go on
to note that this can be estimated only by making repeated measurements.

From the information supplied in that article, a reasonable approximation to the
sample variance-covariance matrix of the differences and averages may be retrieved,
yielding S11 = 213.16, S12 = 58.00, S22 = 546.71. This was used to generate Figure 5.
These ﬁgures are generally in line with their cornrrients, but serve again to indicate the
indeterminacy in the one-measurement case. For example, the changing bias in the
sample could range as high as 33% per unit ($1 : 1133) to —9% per unit  I 0.91).
We believe that the sample correlation of 0.17 and its statistical signiﬁcance would
likely be taken by most users to indicate that ﬁl > 1. However, the entire range of
values is once again equally likely to have generated these data, including [31 : 1,
6,; = 711,65 = 12.8.
8 Example 3: PEFR Revisited
We will use this example to outline the approach we recommend in the multiple-
measurement case. We plan to explain this approach elsewhere in a style designed for
the non-statistician. \Ve again use the PEFR data from Bland and Altman (1986).
There were N = 17 subjects, each of whom was measured twice on each of the Wright

and Mini meters. As those authors noted, those data were collected to illustrate a
statistical method, and we will use it with this in mind as well—the small sample size
would normally be too small for decision making.
Like Bland and Altman, we begin by a graphical examination of the data. How-
ever, those authors used only the ﬁrst measurement of each method to illustrate the
comparison of methods, and used the second measurement only for studying repeata-
bility. Although it is clear to us why they may have done so, it is an inefficient use of
data and, we believe, does not set a good example for data analysis. We will examine
all the data simultaneously.
Before any means or differences are calculated, it is important to look at the
raw data themselves. This cal1 provide unexpected insights. Here, we discovered a
difference between the two measuring devices that, to our knowledge, has not been
noted by Bland and Altman in their publications. The existence of round-off error
of a measuring device can often be considered by examining only the last digit—e.g.,
516 is reduced to a 6. See Figure 6.
The actual readings had a range of over 400 for each meter, so the last digit
is expected to be randomly distributed. This is observed for the Wright Meter.
However, the Mini Meter readings suffer from rounding this is most obvious by the
large number of ()’s, but also reveals itself in the peaks at what we shall call 2.5, 5,
and 7.5. The smaller three peaks are of little consequence here, but the high peak at
O suggests that some readings may have been misread by as much as 5 units. We do
not examine this issue further in the analysis.
Our next plots continue to examine the features of each machine. For each ma-
chine, we recommend a plot of standard deviation vs mean for each subject. However,
for the two-measurement case, a plot of difference vs mean can be used instead—Bland
and Altman (1986) made these same, natural, suggestions. There are two main pur-
poses for such a plot: to see if the standard deviation increases with the mean, and
if so perform an alternate analysis (such as a log transformation of the raw data);

and to look for outliers. Such graphs, not shown here, reveal a very large outlier for
the Mini meter, which Bland and Altman (1986) noted. However, there appear to be
problems with the Wright meter as well, which the authors did not note. Because the
standard deviation does not increase with the mean, we show both sets of differences
with normal quantile-quantile plots. See Figure 7.
The outlying value of —96 stands out for the Mini Meter, but there appears to be
at least one outlier for the Wright data as well. Using the method of Grubbs (1969)
and an algorithm supplied by NIST ( http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/
section3/eda35h.htm) based on G I H1%LX(D1' — D) /$13, where the {D,,i : 1, ..., 17}
are the differences using one of the devices and SD is the sample standard deviation
of the the {Di}, we ﬁnd G = 3.23 for Mini, which is signiﬁcant at P = 0.0006.
This is the only such outlier in the Mini data, and we will set it aside (subject #7).
However, the V\/right data has G = 2.71 and P = 0.03. If this point is set aside and
we re-run the test, we have G = 2.64 and P = 0.04, so there is some evidence of
two outliers. However, this evidence of outliers had P > 0.01, and so we decided to
keep these points. This is in line with Grubbs’ (1969), who wrote “it is generally
recommended that a low signiﬁcance level, such as 1%, be used...”. (The NIST site
uses G above, but the Grubbs statistic used only the “one-sided” version of this test.

Table 1: Hierarchy of Models
For this reason, the on levels and P-values cited there need to be multiplied by 2, and
we have done so here.)
Next, we graphically examine how the two devices compare, using the means
for each subject and device. The main reasons for this plot are twofold: to look
for outliers (a different type than before) and to look for a non-linear relationship.
(Increases in variability with the means would normally be detected in the earlier
plots.) See Figure 8, where the outlier from subject 7 has been removed.
Neither plot suggests any smooth departures from linearity, but the plot on the
right suggests that two additional subjects (numbers 2 and 15) were measured differ-
ently on the two machines.
The standard statistical approach to formally examine such data is based on
a series of structural models. The models we examine are shown in Table 1 and
correspond to the numbered listing at the beginning of Section 2.
The models form a hierarchy with the exception of 2 and 2’. To examine the
models, we start with the largest and search for the smallest model consistent with the
19



data. We use maximum likelihood to ﬁt the models. The deviance (—2log-likelihood)
for Model 4 is 519.30, while for Model 3 it is 532.64. The difference of 13.34 is highly
signiﬁcant (P I 0.0003) when using the standard X? reference distribution, although
the sample sizes are too small here to justify using this reference distribution with
high precision. The outliers in the right-hand plot of Figure 8 and the dramatic
increase in the estimate of measurement standard deviations in moving from Model
4 (65 I 44, 65 I 16,65 I 11) to Model 3 (65 I 0,6,; I 25, 65 I 19) also indicate that
Model 3 does not ﬁt these data well.
One can only theorize why these two subjects were measured so differently for
these data. One would normally want to re-measure them to see if there are con-
sistent differences in the devices or if these were anomalies. For purposes of this
example, we will assume the latter and set these two subjects aside as well. The
deviances for Model 4 (442.99) and Model 3 (447.50) differ by 4.51, which yields
P I 0.033 with the X? reference distribution. Because likelihood methods generally
reject hypotheses at a higher than nominal rate for small sample sizes, there is not
strong evidence to reject Model 3 for Model 4. The increase in the estimate of mea-
surement standard deviations in moving from Model 4 (65 I 21, 65 I 17, 66 I 12) to
Model 3 (65 I 0, 65 I 22,65 I 14) was also less, and there was also no evidence of
other outliers in the right»hand plot of Figure 8.
The deviances for Model 2’ (449.6), Model 2 (448.52) , and Model 1 (451.17, for
which 6,; I 65 I 19) show that Model 1 is the simplest model consistent with the
data for the N I 14 subjects. Based on these results, it is reasonable to summarize
the analysis as follows:
1. The Mini meter measurement on one subject was a clear outlier. (Subjectis
data removed from analysis.)
2. Measurements for two subjects were inconsistent across devices. (May indicate
fundamental differences in devices for certain subjects or at certain times. In
this analysis, we set these subjects’ data aside.)
3. For the remaining N I 14 subjects, the data suggest the devices may function
identically, with a estimated measurement standard deviation of 19 liters/min.
This means that the repeatability is estimated to be 54 liters/min.
The last number is based on the British Standard Institute’s (BSI’s) deﬁnition of
repeatability (1979), the value in which 95% of differences in reading will lie.
Our analysis treats the two devices in a symmetric way and ﬁnds no evidence of
a difference. This contradicts the analysis of Bland (1995, p. 272) who performs an
analysis only on the first reading, and estimates a repeatability value of 78 liters / min.
He states that “on the basis of these data we would not conclude that the two methods
are comparable or that the mini-meter could reliably replace the Wright peak flow
meter.” In fact, after excluding the subject with the obvious outlier from the analysis,
20



the estimates of Within-device measurement error based solely on the duplicate set
of readings were 16 for the Wright meter and 12 for the Mini meter, less (but not
statistically so) than the Wright meter.
9 Example 4. Use of Regression
Bland and Altman (2003) stated that an appropriate use of regression exists for
the case in which a new method has different units from the old (but are, presum-
ably, linearly related). A regression of Y (old) on X (new), when sampling from
a bivariate normal distribution, estimates the regression line E [Y \X] = E [Y] +
pXy (0')//(TX) (X — E [X]), with Var (Y \X) : 0%, (1 — /1%”). Using the structural
equation model, this becomes

As a special case, ﬁrst consider when the two devices are in fact equivalent, which
is the same as comparing the device to itself. In this case
U2
Ell/lXl = H1+ﬁ(X—H1)
Unless there is no measurement error in X , this produces a slope less than 1, as is
well known, and thus gives the regression to the mean phenomenon that Bland and
Altman have repeatedly criticized, including in the (2003) paper itself. (It is true
that this estimate of the next measurement made on the same device, for example,
is a better estimate than the reasonable (but naive) estimate X itself, under the
21



random-ac model that is used here. See Fuller (1987, p. 75) for additional comments.
However, we believe most researchers would be more interested in what we shall call
the unadjusted corrected value, which here would be X , and which in general would
be ,Z3O+E1X, Where the estimates do and K31 would be obtained through the structural-
equation model approach, based on the data from the multiple-measurement case.)
ln the general case, it is clear from (10) that the unadjusted corrected value for
Y will be correct only when X I ,uX (in practice, if the observed X is very close
to the observed mean of the X ’s), but otherwise suffers from the same regression-to-
the-inean phenomenon. As before, in the one-measurement-case, the estimate of ﬂl
cannot be obtained.
Bland and Altman (2003) also recommend that 95% prediction-interval limits be
used as a substitute for their standard 95% limits of agreement. It is diﬂicult for us
to understand why they would make such a recommendation, because the two limits
have little in common, as we now show. The 95% prediction-interval limit is meant to
capture one future value With a 95% chance, Where the 95% takes into account both
the estimate of variability of a future value Y, given X, and the estimated variability
of the regression coeﬂicients involved. These estimated limits are a strongly affected
by the sample size of the data used in the regression. The 95% limits of agreement
take into account the the estimate of the variability of Y X, but do not take into
account any estimated variability of the estimates. Such estimated limits are not very
dependent on the sample size. Suppose We have N pairs of values, and call the 11”’
pair (X,;,Y,), with resulting least square equation of YX = 5/0 + '11 (X — X), where
X is the average of the X,-’s in the sample, and (yo/$1) are the usual least square
estimates. Let the estimated residual standard be denoted by sy,X Then the 95% P.I.

where 5% = 2 (Xi — X)2 / (N — 1) is the sample variance of the X/s, and the de-
pendence of the width on the sample size is clear. Now, these actual values are based
on a particular sample. However, we can examine the properties of the width of this
interval by ﬁrst replacing these estimates with the parameters they are estimating.
This produces a width of

To examine these, consider a variety of ways in which graphs of Y vs. X might
appear. The unitless measure of this association is /2Xy, and We consider /2Xy values
of (0.5, 0.7, 0.9,0.95) for our comparisons. We select (05, 05) values for three cases
to be (10, 0), (O, 10), and (10, 10), respectively, to create the graphs—this choice of
scale has no effect on the relative comparisons. The ﬂxy values for each scenario let
us determine the corresponding ax value based on (10) with ﬂl I 1.
Rather than use these unusual intervals, the user could consider Y :1: z9_975sy|X.
This leads to the following estimated interval widths, which we call regression zmldths.
For the 0,; I 0 case, the width estimates 2z9_975a6, which is identical to the agree-
ment Width, and independent of pxy. For the 0'5 I O case, the width estimate
2z0_975a,;, / 1/ (1 + Ric) I 2z@_975a,;pXY, which will be slightly smaller than the 2z0_975o5
agreement width, and especially so for smaller values of pxy. (The P.I. approach
makes this slightly larger for smaller samples sizes, but not because of any good theo-
retical reasons.) For the 05 I 06 case. the width estimate 2\/iZ[)_975O'51/1 — Rgm/2 (1 + R6 ) I
2\/52097505, / (1 + p§(y) /2p§ﬂ,., which is again slightly less than the 2\/52097505 dif»
ference width.
In fact, we can do better than this—from the data, We can estimate pxy and this
2 2
in turn lets us ﬁnd an upper bound for the width. Because /)Xy < q / (1 + pxy) /2/)XY
for 0 < pxy < 1, this upper bound is Y i 20975 (5;/(X /pxy). (Note: it appears that
this upper bound would always based on the 05 I 0 case, but but we have not
proven this.) Call this Width the regression max width. From this, we compare the
BA difference widths (which Bland and Altman are trying to estimate) to the BA
prediction interval Widths (minimum and maximum), the regression Width, and the
regression max width. See Figures 9 to 11. From these, it is clear that the regression

10 Recommendations
The use of the BA methodology is certainly to be preferred to the other methods that
Bland and Altman have criticized. However, We are very concerned on the emphasis
they place on the one-measurement cases in their examples. This, we believe, inad-
vertently suggests to researchers that such a methodology is acceptable. I11 Altmanls
(1995) generally excellent textbook, for example, he stated “For simplicity, I shall
use only one measurement by each method here. We could make use of the duplicate
data by using the average of each pair ﬁrst, but this introduces an extra stage in the
calculation. Bland and Altman (1986) give details.”
It is true that Bland and Altman (1986) give formulas for the multiple-measurement
case, near the end of that article. Ironically though, even when they have two readings
available per subje<:t/ device, they still only use ﬁrst to illustrate the BA plot this
may be simpler to explain, perhaps, but it is not an appropriate way to analyze these
data. We believe in simple analysis, but not at the expense of properly using the data

for modeling.
Our recommendations are simple.
1. If physically possible, repeated measurements on each device for each subject
should be required.
2. The extended structural equation model should be used for analysis. Plots,
including sample standard deviations versus means (or, in the case of two-
measurement studies, second measurement versus ﬁrst measurement) for each
device, Y vs. X, and the BA plot, should be used along with formal tests to
check for model adequacy—this includes outliers, nonlinear relationships, and
non-constancy of variance.
3. If the model is adequate, provide estimates and conﬁdence intervals of the pa-
rameters and other related quantities. The latter may include estimates that
are related to local standards, such as those of BS1.
We will illustrate the use of extended structural equation models, including model
checking, in a separate article. It is our intent to do this is such a way to allow these
methods to become easily accessible to researchers.

of population parameters. For a sample of data, simply replace E with its estimate
S.
Deﬁne the ratios R1 = (2212 + E11) / (4222 — E11) ,Rg = (2212 — E11) / (4222 — E11)
where E,-j is the (i,j)m element of E. Next, deﬁne I2 I R3; — 1 —2R2R§5 — 2R1. Then,
a lengthy but straightforward calculation shows that
5, : <—b+,/b2+4R§6>/2
Rt» = —m<m-1—2R1)/R56
"Z = (4E22—311)/(451)
From this, we can calculate related quantities of interest. For example, erg =
2 2 2 _ 2 2 2
UzR5w and Us i (7a:R6wRe6'
With the information on ﬁl, we can also calculate /it : 2 (/12 — pl) / 2 and then
50 = H1 — (/51 *1)/Jr
