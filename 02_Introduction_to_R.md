Introduction to R 
==============================

In this part of the workshop, we will provide a very brief introduction to the R environment. 
Truthfully, we will be covering the bare minimum, and there is plenty of interesting and useful material that we will be leaving out, for the sake of time.

1. A quick tour of the Rstudio environment.

 - Script Editor (top left)
 - R Console  (bottom left)
 - R Environment information (top right)
 - R Output View (bottom right)
 
2. Installing and loading an R package

 - This may be familiar to everybody who attempted to pre-install R packages.
 
3. Creating and running a short R script

 - Adding Comments (with the "#" symbol)
