\section{Off-Diagonal Components in Roy's Model}

The Within-item variability is specified as follows, where $x$ and $y$ are the methods of measurement in question.
\[ \left(
     \begin{array}{cc}
       \sigma^2_x & \sigma_{xy} \\
       \sigma_{xy} & \sigma^2_y \\
     \end{array}
   \right)
 \]

$\sigma^2_x$ and $\sigma^2_y$ describe the level of measurement error associated with each of the measurement methods for a given item. Attention must be given to the off-diagonal elements of the matrix.

It is intuitive to consider the measurement error of the two methods as independent of each other.

\section{Formal Testing}
A formal test can be performed to test the hypothesis that the off-diagonal terms are zero.
\[ \left(
     \begin{array}{cc}
       \sigma^2_x & \sigma_xy \\
       \sigma_xy & \sigma^2_y \\
     \end{array}
   \right) vs \left(
     \begin{array}{cc}
       \sigma^2_x & 0 \\
       0 & \sigma^2_y \\
     \end{array}
   \right)
 \]
