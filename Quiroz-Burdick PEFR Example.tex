\section{Quiroz-Burdick PEFR Example}

The data consist of two paired measurements on the same subject made with the large Wright peak flow meter and a mini
Wright meter.

Paired differences of less than 101/min are considered of no practical clinical significance. That is to say, it would have no bearing on
any decision related to a clinical matter.

A serious error would be declare that the mini-meter is as effective as the large meter when in fact it is not.
